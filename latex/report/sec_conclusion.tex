% If promising, then future work:
% - Currently all nodes are in reverse order of how they are processed
%   - If these algorithm could output in the order of the next, then this could
%     lead to a speedup by pipelining the execution of all these algorithms!
% - Complement edges to minimise the size of the OBBD
