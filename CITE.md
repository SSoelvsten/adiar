### Adiar [1.0](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/adiar/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

With [v1.0.0](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/adiar/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (and its
patch [v1.0.1](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/adiar/releases/tag/v1.0.1)) we
provide an implementation of the above algorithms and also add non-trivial
optimisations, extensions, and new theoretical contributions to make it usable
in practice.
