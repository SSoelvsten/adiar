# Examples
![examples](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/adiar/workflows/examples/badge.svg?branch=main)

To benchmark the implementation and also to provide examples of how to use
_Adiar_ in your project, we provide a few examples. Even more examples can be
found at the [BDD Benchmarking repository](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/bdd-benchmark).

All examples have an _M_ variable to be set for the MiB of memory that is to be
available to _Adiar_. The default is 1024 MiB.

## N-Queens

**Files:** `queens.cpp`

**Target:** `make example/queens N=<?>`

Solve the N-Queens problem for _N = `?`_ (default: `8`). This is done by
constructing an BDD row-by-row that represents whether the row is in a legal
state: is at least one queen placed on each row and is it also in no conflicts
with any other? On this BDD we then counts the number of satisfying
assignments [[kunkle10](#references)].

To list the solutions, we take the same BDD, but instead of counting the number
of assignments within, we use it to prune a recursive enumeration of all
possible queen placements. For up to _N = 8_ we run both the solution counting
procedure and the enumeration procedure.

**Notice**: This is a pretty simple example and has all of the normal
shortcomings for BDDs trying to solve the N-Queens problem. At around _N_ = 14
the intermediate sizes explodes a lot. One can with about 100 GB of disk space
or memory compute it.
