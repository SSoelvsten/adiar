# Cache-Oblivious OBBD Manipulation
While at research meeting I asked the whether really _noone has yet been looking
into Cache-Oblivious OBBD manipulation_, which after a bit of searching turned
up a paper by Lars Arge from 1996 about external-memory OBBD manipulation. The
main points of the paper is:

- The DFS, BFS and other algorithms at the time had a worst case `O(N)` I/O
  complexity.
- The lower bound for both a _Reduce_ and _Apply_ algorithm is `O(sort(N)) =
  O(N/B log_{M/B}(N/B))`
- It provides an I/O optimal external-memory algorithm for both _Reduce_ and
  _Apply_
- If the OBBD is represented by the _low_ and _high_ arcs, then the output of
  _Reduce_ is already in sorted order for the _Apply_ algorithm, and vica versa.
  
Looking at the algorithm you will further notice the following:

- The algorithm does not explicitly make use of `M` or `B` but only an I/O
  efficient sorting algorithm and priority queue. Both of these can be
  substituted for a _Cache-oblivious_ instance to immediately yield a
  cache-oblivious algorithm!

Immediate risks of this project are is that since _Reduce_ and _Apply_ are
separate algorithms, then the implementation might end up much slower due to the
intermediate size of the OBBD or by having to run two algorithms separately.

- The major question is whether this can be circumvented with pipelining (e.g.
  [TPIE](https://github.com/thomasmoelhave/tpie)). Even though before starting
  the _Reduce_ the whole result of the _Apply_ algorithm has to be outputted,
  and vica versa, can we set off the cost by doing some of the things below?
  - The next algorithm does not sort its input (as it already is outputted in
    sorted order)
  - The sorted list of whereto computation has to be forwarded in the _Reduce_
    algorithm can be replaced by a priority queue which can already be filled up
    during the _Apply_ computation.
    - Or would this result in more cache-misses of the _Apply_ algorithm and a
      sorting of a massive input afterwards is __always__ quicker?

## Bibliography
Copies of the most relevant papers are placed here for convenience.

## Pseudocode
To better understand the algorithm in detail, the `Reduce` and `Apply` algorithm
have been written as pseudocode. These are _python_ files for the syntax
highlighting, but that does not mean they are supposed to be compilable and
possible to run. These have then been extended with other commonly used
algorithms.

paper in the event the benchmark results are promising.
