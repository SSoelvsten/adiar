Based on the work of Lars Arge [[Arge96](#references)], Adiar<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup>
is a BDD package [[Bryant86](#references)] that makes use of _Time-Forward Processing_
to improve the I/O complexity of BDD Manipulation. This makes it able to achieve
efficient manipulation of BDDs, even when they outgrow the memory limit of the
given machine.

## Documentation
The documentation is provided as a collection of Markdown files in the _docs/_
folder, which are also viewable on [Github Pages](https://ssoelvsten.github.io/adiar/).


## Dependencies
The implementation is dependant on the the following external libraries

- [**TPIE**](https://github.com/thomasmoelhave/tpie):

  Framework for implementation of I/O efficient algorithms. It directly provides
  sorting algorithms and a priotity queue. Both are much faster than the
  algorithms in the _C++_ standard library
  [[Vengroff94](#references), [Mølhave12](#references)].

- [**Bandit**](https://github.com/banditcpp/bandit):

  Unit testing framework that is easy-to-read and write.

These are directly imported as submodules. If you have not cloned the repository
recursively, then run the following command

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Other dependencies that we cannot provide as a submodule are shown below. The
_ticked_ dependencies are mandatory to install.

- [x] **CMake** and a **C++ compiler**

  One also needs a _C++_ compiler that supports the _17_ standard and _CMake_.
  All development has currently been with the _gcc_ compiler, so we cannot
  guarantee other compilers will work out-of-the-box.

- [x] **Boost**

  Furthermore, TPIE has a dependency on the [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)
  Library.

- [ ] **DOT**

  As a visual aid, the internal representation of the Decision Diagrams can be
  output as
  [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) files.
  These can then be turned into a graphical representation by use of a number of
  tools, such as _graphviz_.

To install all of the above then run the respective below.

| Operating System | Shell command                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Ubuntu 18+       | `apt install cmake g++     libboost-all-dev graphviz` |
| Fedora 35+       | `dnf install cmake gcc-c++ boost-devel      graphviz` |

## Usage

### Makefile targets

The project is build with _CMake_, though for convenience I have simplified the
_CMake_ interactions to a single _Makefile_ which works on a local machine. This
has only been tested on _Ubuntu 18.04 LTS_ and _20.04 LTS_.

The _Makefile_ provides the following targets

| target          | effect                                                               |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `build`         | Build the source files                                               |
| `clean`         | Remove all build files                                               |
|                 |                                                                      |
| `test`          | Run all unit tests (with _O2_ optimisations)                         |
| `coverage`      | Run all unit tests (with no optimisations) and create _lcov_ report  |
|                 |                                                                      |
| `main M=<MiB>`  | Run the _main_ function in `src/main.cpp` with `<MiB>` MiB of memory |

### Examples
The _example/_ folder contains examples for using the data structures in Adiar.
The _README.md_ file in said folder contains a more in-depth description of each
of the examples. Even more examples and benchmarks are provided in a separate
[BDD Benchmarking repository](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/bdd-benchmark).

Each example takes a set of arguments as input, which can be parsed to the
program as a makefile variable. That is, to change the value of _N_ to to value
follow the `make <target>` with `N=<value>`.

**example/queens**

| variable | description                   |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| _N_      | Board size (default: 8)       |
| _M_      | Memory in MiB (default: 1024) |

**example/knights-tour/[T]** 

The value **T** can either be _all_or _closed_.

| variable | description                                      |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| _N_      | Board size (default: 8)                          |
| _M_      | Memory in MiB (default: 1024)                    |

## Contributions

Adiar is not yet feature complete, and there are still many interesting things
left for _you_ to do. We already list lots of suggestions for possible projects
as [future work](/FUTURE_WORK.md) and other possible things to contribute with
as [issues](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/adiar/issues).
