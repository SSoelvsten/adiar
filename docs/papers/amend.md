During the further development of Adiar, we have revisited, revised, and
iterated up our prior ideas. What follows is a record of these changes, leaving
the information in prior papers out of date.

64-bit Encoding of Pointers
========================

In the [extended arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12101) for [[TACAS
22](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_16)], we show in
Section 3.5 how to encode the *unique identifier* into a single 64-bit integer.
This is (1) to decrease the BDD size and especially (2) to make the pointer
sorting operations as fast as possible.

v1.2
------------------------

It was always the intention that the *flag* bit on children should be used for
the addition of *complement edges* in BDDs. Yet, up to this point it was left
unused. Hence, we reassigned the meaning of this bit to instead propagate an
edge being *tainted* by the decision diagram's reduction rule [[ATVA
23](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-45332-8_4)].

v2.0
------------------------

For *Nested Sweeping*, we need to *taint* an arc's *source* to be originating
from the *outer sweep*. Yet, the *flag* was up to this point used to store the
*out-index* of the source. Hence, for *internal nodes* we introduce the
out-index (*p*) on the second least-significant bit - essentially adding a
second (possibly non-Boolean) *flag*.

**Figure 10 (b):**

|     |                            |                                         |     |     |
|-----|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----|-----|
| `0` | `. . . . . label. . . . .` | `. . . . . . . identifier. . . . . . .` | `o` | `f` |

At this point, *o* only uses 1 bit, but in the case of *Quantum Multi-valued
Decision Diagrams* this would use 2 bits to handle the 4-ary outdegree.

Yet, the above introduction of the out-index, *o*, removes a bit from the number
of *level identifiers*. This decreases the maximum width without an overflow
downto only 3 TiB. Hence, the maximum size of a BDD without possible overflow is
only 6 TiB.

To get the maximum width safe from overflows back up to 6 TiB, we have removed
the most significant *terminal bit flag*. Instead, now all pointers dedicate the
ℓ most significant bits to its *level*. The largest level is dedicated to *null*
and the second-largest to *terminals*. This decreases the number of BDD labels
by 2 and also restricts *terminal* values to fit into 64-ℓ-1-1 = 62-ℓ bits. Yet,
this is fine for `bool`, `char`, `int`, and `float`.
