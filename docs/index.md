# Adiar
{: .fs-9 }

*Adiar* is a library for manipulating Decision Diagrams even when these grow
bigger than the memory one has available. To achieve this, all operations are
not implemented recursively with a shared unique node table, but instead they
are created as streaming algorithms that exploit a specific sorting of diagram
nodes on disk to delay recursion.

## About the project

This project has been developed at the [Logic and Semantics](https://logsem.github.io/)
group at [Aarhus University](https://cs.au.dk).

Using Adiar will indirectly use [TPIE](https://github.com/thomasmoelhave/tpie)
underneath, which in turn is licensed under the _LGPL v3_ license. Hence, a
binary of yours that is statically linked to Adiar will be affected by that
license. That is, if you share that binary with others, then you will be obliged
to make the source public. This can be resolved by using Adiar as a shared
library or have it use an alternative to TPIE, such as
[STXXL](https://stxxl.org/).
