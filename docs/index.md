# Adiar

{: .fs-9 }

_Adiar_ is a library for manipulating Binary Decision Diagrams even when these
grow bigger than the memory one has available. To achieve this, all operations
are not implemented recursively with a global memoization table, but instead
they are created as streaming algorithms that exploit the sorting of the graph
on disk to delay recursion with Time-Forward Processing.
