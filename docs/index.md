# Adiar
{: .fs-9 }

_Adiar_ is a library for manipulating Decision Diagrams even when these grow
bigger than the memory one has available. To achieve this, all operations are
not implemented recursively with a shared unique node table, but instead they
are created as streaming algorithms that exploit the sorting of the graph on
disk to delay recursion with Time-Forward Processing.

## About the project

This project has been developed at the [Logic and Semantics](https://logsem.github.io/)
group at [Aarhus University](https://cs.au.dk).

**Current Maintainer:** [Steffan SÃ¸lvsten](mailto:soelvsten@cs.au.dk)

### License
The software and documentation files in this repository are provided under the
[GPL 3 License](/LICENSE.md). In short, you can use Adiar in any project (also a
closed-source commercial one), but if you change Adiar itself, then you have to
make the changes to Adiar public.

Using Adiar will indirectly use [TPIE](https://github.com/thomasmoelhave/tpie)
underneath, which in turn is licensed under the _GPL 3_ license. Hence, your
resulting binaries linked to Adiar will also be under that license. If you share
that binary with others, then you will be obliged to make the source public.
This can be resolved by making Adiar use an alternative to TPIE, such as
[STXXL](https://github.com/stxxl/stxxl).
